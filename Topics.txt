Sprint Backlog:
-A Sprint backlog is a list of tasks or user stories that a development team plans
 to work on during a specific sprint in Agile software development. 
-It's derived from the prioritized product backlog and includes the items 
 selected for the sprint, along with the tasks needed to complete them. 
-The Sprint backlog is dynamic and may change as the team progresses through the sprint.

Sprint:
-In Agile methodology, a sprint is a time-boxed iteration, usually lasting between 
 one to four weeks, where a development team works on a set of tasks or user stories determined 
 during the sprint planning meeting. 
-Sprints allow teams to focus on delivering a potentially shippable product increment 
 at the end of each iteration, fostering transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

Product Owner:
-The Product Owner in Agile development is a key role responsible for representing 
 the interests of the stakeholders and ensuring that the development team builds the right product. 
-They are typically accountable for managing the product backlog, prioritizing user stories, 
 and providing clear direction and requirements to the development team. 
-The Product Owner works closely with stakeholders to gather feedback, make decisions, and 
 ensure the product meets business objectives and customer needs.

Product Backlog:
-The product backlog is a prioritized list of all desired work on a product, 
 maintained by the product owner in Agile methodology. 
-It contains user stories, defects, enhancements, and any other tasks that need to be 
 addressed to fulfill the product vision. 
-The items in the backlog are ordered based on their value to the business and customers, 
 with the most important items at the top. 
-The product backlog is dynamic and evolves over time as new information emerges, priorities change, and the product evolves.

Scrum Master:
-The Scrum Master is a facilitator and servant leader within the Scrum framework, 
 responsible for ensuring that the Scrum team adheres to Scrum principles and practices. 
-They coach the team on Agile and Scrum principles, facilitate Scrum events such as sprint planning, 
 daily stand-ups, sprint review, and sprint retrospective meetings. 
-The Scrum Master also removes impediments that hinder the team's progress, fosters a collaborative and 
 self-organizing team environment, and helps to improve the team's efficiency and effectiveness over time.

Increment:
-In Agile development, an increment refers to the sum of all the product backlog items 
 completed during a sprint, plus the value of the work from all previous sprints. 
-It is a tangible, usable, and potentially releasable product increment that demonstrates progress 
 toward the product's vision and goals. Each increment should be fully functional, meeting the definition of done, 
 and ready for review by stakeholders. 
-Increments are built iteratively and incrementally, allowing for continuous feedback and improvement throughout the development process.

Daily Scrum:
-The Daily Scrum, also known as the Daily Stand-up, is a short, time-boxed meeting in Agile and Scrum methodology 
 where the development team gathers to synchronize their activities and plan for the day. 
-It typically lasts no longer than 15 minutes and is held at the same time and place every day. 
-During the Daily Scrum, each team member answers three questions: 
       1. What did I do yesterday?
       2. What will I do today?
       3. Are there any impediments blocking my progress?
-The Daily Scrum helps the team stay aligned, identify any potential issues or blockers early on, 
 and ensures that progress is being made towards the sprint goal.

Sprint Retrospective:
-The Sprint Retrospective is a meeting held at the end of each sprint in Agile methodology, 
 where the Scrum team reflects on the previous sprint to identify what went well, what didn't go well, 
 and areas for improvement. 
-It's an opportunity for the team to inspect and adapt their processes, tools, and 
 behaviors to become more effective and efficient. During the Sprint Retrospective, team members typically discuss:
       1. What went well during the sprint (positives)?
       2. What didn't go well (negatives)?
       3. What actions can be taken to improve in the next sprint?
-The Sprint Retrospective fosters continuous improvement and helps the team address issues and 
 make adjustments to enhance their performance in future sprints.
