Test Case:
----------
A test case template is a document that comes under one of the test artifacts, 
which allows testers to develop the test cases for a particular test scenario 
in order to verify whether the features of an application are working as intended or not.

Test cases are the set of positive and negative executable steps of a test scenario 
which has a set of pre-conditions, test data, expected results, post-conditions, and actual results.

Most of the companies are using test case management tools such as Quality Center (HP QC), JIRA, etc., 
and some of the companies still using excel sheets to write test cases.
