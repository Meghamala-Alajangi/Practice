1.What are indexes in SQL database?
     -An index is a schema object. 
     -It is used by the server to speed up the retrieval of rows by using a 
      pointer. 

2.Data Stores
    A data store is a digital repository that stores and safeguards the 
       information in computer systems. 
     -A data store can be network-connected storage, distributed cloud storage, 
      a physical hard drive, or virtual storage. 

3.AWS :: Redis
     -AWS offers two fully managed services to run Redis and Redis Enterprise Cloud 
      (Pay-as-you-go) in AWS Marketplace. 
     -Redis Enterprise Cloud is a fully managed cache and database-as-a-service for 
      real-time use-cases offered by the creators of Redis. 

4.In-memory storages :: Ephemeral Storages
     -Ephemeral storage is temporary storage that does not extend beyond the 
      life of an individual pod. 
     -When a pod finishes or is restarted, any data stored in ephemeral storage 
      is cleared out.

5.Data state | Data storage
   Data state 
    -A data state descirbes different modes whereby data is used by computing equipment.
     -The term applies to information security and efforts to encrypt data in each state.
     
   Data storage
    Used to capture and retain digital data on storage devices.

6.Persistent | Non-persistent storage 
  Persistent Storage
       Even when the machine [storage device/server/database server/etc] 
       is switched OFF : data remains
      -Device that is used for storing the data.
      -Saves the data even if the power is turned off therefore they are also known as 
       non-volatile material. 

   Non-persistent storage 
       Even when the machine [storage device/server/database server/etc] 
       is switched OFF : data goes away
      -Non-persistence data is not available after fully closing the application.
      
7. Enterprise Application

An enterprise application(EA) is a large software system platform 
      typically designed to operate in a corporate environment such as 
      business or government. 

8.  NPM vs NPX? 
     NPM
The npm stands for Node Package Manager and it is the default package manager 
       for Node.js.  
      -It is written entirely in JavaScript. 
      -The npm manages all the packages and modules for node.js and consists of 
       command-line client npm.
NPX
-The npx stands for Node Package Execute and it comes with the npm.
      -When you installed npm above 5.2.0 version then automatically npx will installed. 
      -It is an npm package runner that can execute any package that you want from the 
       npm registry without even installing that package. 

9. Types of testing

Testing 
Testing is a method to assess the functionality of the software program. 
        -The process checks whether the actual software matches the expected requirements 
         and ensures the software is bug-free. 

Unit testing
      
        -is a method of testing individual units or components of a software application. 
        -It is typically done by developers and is used to ensure that the individual units
         of the software are working as intended. Unit tests are usually automated and are
         designed to test specific parts of the code, such as a particular function or method. 
        

Functional testing
      
        -defined as a type of testing that verifies that each function of the software 
         application works in conformance with the requirement and specification. 
        -This testing is not concerned with the source code of the application. 
        

 E2E [end-to-end testing]
   
        -software testing used to test whether the flow of a software from initial stage to 
         final stage is behaving as expected. 
        -The purpose of end-to-end testing is to identify system dependencies and to make 
         sure that the data integrity is maintained between various system components and systems. 
        
 API Testing
     
        -process of confirming that an API is working as expected. 
        -Developers can run API tests manually, or they can automate them with an API testing tool. 
        
Security testing
     
        -uncovers vulnerabilities, threats, risks in a software application and prevents malicious 
         attacks from intruders. 
        -The purpose of Security Tests is to identify all possible loopholes and weaknesses of the 
         software system which might result in a loss of information, revenue, repute at the hands 
         of the employees or outsiders of the Organization.


 Peformance testing
       
        -process used for testing the speed, response time, stability, reliability, scalability, 
         and resource usage of a software application under a particular workload. 
        -The main purpose of performance testing is to identify and eliminate the performance 
         bottlenecks in the software application. 



 Monkey testing
      
        -software testing in which the tester tests the application or software by providing 
         some random inputs and checking the behavior of the application or the software. 
        -It is also observed by seeing whether the application or software crashes on a given input or not. 
        -Monkey testing is usually implemented as random and automated unit testing.



 Hashmap
     -Java HashMap is similar to HashTable, but it is unsynchronized. 
     -It allows to store the null keys as well, but there should be only one null key object and 
      there can be any number of null values. 


 What is ArrayList?
     -ArrayList is a Java class implemented using the List interface. 
     -Java ArrayList, provides the functionality of a dynamic array where the size is not fixed as an array. 
     -Also, as a part of the Collection framework, it has many features not available with arrays.


API
     ---
     -An API stands for Application Program Interface. 
     -It is a set of instructions, protocols, and tools for building software applications. 
     -It specifies how software components should interact.
    

 Gateway API
    -----------
    -The API Gateway is a server. 
    -It is a single entry point into a system. 
    -API Gateway encapsulates the internal system architecture. 
    -It provides an API that is tailored to each client. 
    

 Rest API
     --------
     -REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and API stands for Application Program Interface. 
     -REST is a software architectural style that defines the set of rules to be used for creating web services. 
     -Web services which follow the REST architectural style are known as RESTful web services. 
     -It allows requesting systems to access and manipulate web resources by using a uniform and predefined 
      set of rules. 
     

 What is an interface and its uses?
      -The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. 
      -There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body. 
      -It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritances in Java using Interface.
